# ruby

This folder include my ruby files. 

~~Although they're in a mess, they're useful when I need them.~~
I have cleaned my files (for a little...)

I think these files contains most of my work in ruby.I am very proud that I can get access to this language. Although there are still many other things to learn in Ruby, and it really takes time, I will always learn Ruby and some of its new features just because I love it.

I really love this language as Ruby make me do what I want without any limitation. In Ruby, I can:
+ Coding in a human way of thinking. For example, We hardly use 'for' (I don't think 'for' means circulation in English). We use 'each', 'loop' and 'times' just like "each of ... in an array/iterator/range", "loop dosomething", "do ... for 3 times", which present as "['a','b'].each{}","loop{}","3.times{}". Even someone who haven't learned this language can understand what a ruby program line means
+ Interface programming. Ruby has gtk2 and tk gem to support the interface programming. If I am tired of the command input box.
+ Threads. Ruby has simple way to process Threads, and you don't need to install any gems for it. Although it's a little hard to learn at first, I finally got it. It's useless to speed up huge amount of calculation( because the processing between threads are "concurrent"), but it's useful when we make file processing or spiders.
+ Trees. As ruby has wonderful 'bits' process( My meaning is it's friendly for humans, not for machines),just 7[0..1] => 3 (final two bits of 00000111). we can make an array to save the structure of tree, and the bits '0' and '1' are the left and right branch of the node. It is wonderful to make a tree without using class.
+ interesting operation. Ruby can do everything. That's "everything", maybe something unsafe. move your mouse and double click everywhere( and you might have your computer crash, haha!), beep, use system() to do what command prompt can do, open an excel and fill in the chart or draw the bar chart using WIN32OLE, and so on.
